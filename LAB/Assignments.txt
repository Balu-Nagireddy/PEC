Exercise:
---------
1)
a)Write a java bean class named Employee(empId,ename,sal) -->Constructors ,setters and getters, toString().
b)Write a java program to add Employee object into TreeSet and
  perform custom sorting using sal field (Comparator class)   and display the records in descending order.

Ex:
---
Employee e1 = new  Employee(23,"smith",4000);
Employee e2 = new  Employee(10,"martin",5000);
Employee e3 = new  Employee(40,"allen",8000);
Employee e4 = new  Employee(21,"scott",1000);
Employee e5 = new  Employee(23,"smith",4000);

output:
-------
